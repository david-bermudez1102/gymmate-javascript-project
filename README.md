# Gymmate Javascript Project
## Installation
### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/david-bermudez1102/gymmate-javascript-project

```
### Additional installation instructions
For the back end, enter rails db:migrate on your terminal, and for the front end, run node server.js.

Front end is located in port 8000 and API is located in port 3000.

If you open the index.html, the URL may change since Window.pushHistory() by JS was used. If the page is refreshed when the server is not active, you'll get an error.

server.js redirects all routes to index.html file, except for static files.

## Configuration
The app is ready to use. Just make sure last version of node is installed to have a better interaction with the page.
## Operating
All the front end views are located inside of the front-end folder. Each class have their MVC pattern.

To use Gymmate, simply create an account first as a trainer or gym goer and you are logged in!
